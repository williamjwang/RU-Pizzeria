# RU-Pizzeria

🍕This Android application enables the user to add and remove customized pizzas and orders from a hypothetical pizzeria.

🍕When a pizza is being customized, the subtotal changes dynamically with the number of added toppings or if the size is changed and is displayed.

🍕As pizzas are added to the order, the subtotal, sales tax, and total cost of the order are also dynamically changed and is displayed.
